SystemManagement-GSP
====================

This is a system management interface to the telnet-based "GSP" tool.
The Hewlett-Packard version of it is called "HP Management Processor"
or "MP" for short.  Web access is also available, but it just spawns
a Java client to tunnel to the same telnet interface.  This appears to
be the only way to have a secure connection (using the Java to tunnel
through HTTPS).

For more details, see the POD documentation.
